This project is for study purposes. 

Perfect Numbers are something that fascinate me, since they're very rare and appear to have curious properties. From time to time, I try to apply something new I've learned to help me 
calculating them more efficiently, for practicing what I've learned and, of course, for fun. 

But this is not only about Perfect Numbers. There'll be probably a lot of random math stuff here. Feel free to give me ideas, suggestions, criticize what I do and complain about anything.
